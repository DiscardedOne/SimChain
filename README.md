# SimChain üîó

An educational prototype of a blockchain built entirely in C# to illustrate the mechanics of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.

## Overview

SimChain is a pure C# educational blockchain implementation that demonstrates blockchain fundamentals through hands-on interaction. Built from scratch as a .NET Core console application, it focuses on proof-of-work consensus with multi-threaded mining simulation, cryptographic security, and distributed network validation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start (No Development Setup Required)

If you don't want to tinker with code and just want to run the exe, go to bin/Debug/.net8.0 and run the BlockchainSim.exe to start the program in a terminal.

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- Visual Studio 2019+ or VS Code
- Basic understanding of C# and blockchain concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiscardedOne/SimChain.git
cd simchain
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

## üìñ Usage

### Initial Configuration

When you start SimChain, you'll be prompted to configure:

1. **Number of Miners**: How many concurrent miners to simulate (e.g., 3-5)
2. **Complexity Level**: Mining difficulty as number of leading zeros (e.g., 3-5)
3. **Cryptographic Keys**: Provide existing keys or generate new ones

### Main Operations

#### **1. Add Block**
```
> Add Record
> Enter data: "Transfer 50 coins from Alice to Bob"
```
- Data gets encrypted with your public key
- All miners compete to solve proof-of-work
- Block added if >90% miner consensus achieved
- Miners receive rewards for successful mining

#### **2. Read Block**
```
> View Record/Read Block
> Enter Block ID: [block-hash-id]
```
- Retrieves block from blockchain
- Decrypts data using your private key
- Displays original transaction data

#### **3. Verify Chain**
```
> Verify LocalChain
```
- Validates blockchain integrity across all miners
- Updates local chain if consensus indicates discrepancies
- Displays chain status and any updates performed

#### **4. Display Chain**
```
Current Blockchain: [1] -- [2] -- [3] -- [4]
```
- Visual representation of current blockchain state
- Shows number of blocks and linking structure

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Mining Process Flow

1. **Block Creation**: New block initialized with data and previous block hash
2. **Concurrent Mining**: All miners simultaneously attempt to find valid nonce
3. **Proof-of-Work**: Miners iterate nonce values until hash meets complexity requirement
4. **Validation**: Block verified against each miner's local blockchain
5. **Consensus**: Block accepted only with >90% miner agreement
6. **Chain Update**: Successful blocks added to all miner chains with >50% acceptance

### Chain Verification Algorithm

1. **Length Check**: Compare blockchain lengths across miners
2. **Hash Validation**: Verify each block hash in sequence
3. **Consensus Calculation**: Determine acceptance percentage
4. **Auto-Healing**: Update chains that fall below 90% consensus
5. **Score Calculation**: Update miner chain scores based on network agreement

### Cryptographic Security

- **RSA Encryption**: Data encrypted with public/private key pairs
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Block integrity and proof-of-work validation
- **Digital Signatures**: Transaction authenticity verification
- **Nonce-based Mining**: Computational proof-of-work implementation
